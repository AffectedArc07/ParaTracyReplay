# ParaTracyReplay

Allows loading of `.utracy` files generated by [https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/byond-tracy](https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/byond-tracy) to then be captured by Tracy.

Works with Tracy 0.8.2 and Paradise's fork of byond-tracy as of [6168fac975061bb20faf26c0d5c0f41ca4be6e75](https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/byond-tracy/commit/6168fac975061bb20faf26c0d5c0f41ca4be6e75). This is latest as of time of writing (2023-05-02), with subsequent commits being documentation changes.

## Usage

1. Build with Visual Studio or grab the latest release.
2. `ParaTracyReplay.exe your_file.utracy`.
3. Connect `capture.exe` or `tracy.exe` to `127.0.0.1:8086`.
4. Wait for the data to finish streaming.

## Why

This is approximately 5x faster than the [Python script it was based on](https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/byond-tracy/blob/6168fac975061bb20faf26c0d5c0f41ca4be6e75/replay.py), and has proper type safety. The former may not sound like an issue with small traces, but when you have a profile spanning an entire 2 hour round (40GB), the speed **REALLY** starts to matter.

## Contributing 

Just make PRs and test them, the contribution rules on this repo are pretty loose, just don't take a mile.

## Thanks

Special thanks to @mafemergency for making `byond-tracy` and the original python script, and to @FiniteReality for helping with some final implementation issues.
